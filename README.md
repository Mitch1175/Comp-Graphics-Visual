# How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The skills I learned allowed me to create a cool 3D scene which contained a hat, cup, stone, and book. All of the features were new to me. I used openGL through C++ to complete the project. Future work could be made by using skills such as shape formation, lighting, and camera movement.

# How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I learned C++ prior, this year, but I was able to take code I remembered to incorporate it in a new way. I was able to not only create shapes, but also pick where they were placed, how big or small they were, and what they looked like. Each milestone helped to create an object in the final project. By the end, all I had to do was create three more objects and I had a successful scene.

# How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Every coding class adds another aspect to what is possible with a coding language. I had previously heard about C++ being able to create games, but had not seen it until now. Taking C++ earlier in the year set me up for success in this class. Professionally, it may help me get a job by showing a digital portfolio of my work and showing the interviewer what I am capable of.
